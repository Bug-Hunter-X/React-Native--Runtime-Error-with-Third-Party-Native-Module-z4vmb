To solve this, carefully review the library's documentation to ensure proper installation and linking. If using a library manager like CocoaPods (iOS) or Gradle (Android), make sure the library is correctly integrated into your native project.  If you have access to the native module's source code, debug it for any errors.  A clean and rebuild of your project can resolve transient issues. Finally, ensure your build settings are correctly configured to include the native modules.

**Example Solution (Illustrative):**
Assuming you confirmed the linking is correct, the code itself doesn't need changes. But, you might need to add some error handling to gracefully handle the case where the native module is still not available:
```javascript
import AwesomeLibrary from 'react-native-awesome-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  let result = 'Library not available.';
  try {
    result = AwesomeLibrary.doSomethingAwesome();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error using AwesomeLibrary:', error);
  }
  return <Text>{result}</Text>;
};
```
This improved version adds a `try...catch` block to catch any errors during the library call and provides a fallback message.

This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that has native modules but doesn't properly handle the linking process.  This often manifests as a runtime error when trying to access a function or property of the native module. The app might crash or display a generic error message like `undefined is not an object (evaluating '...someNativeModuleName.someFunction')` or a similar message indicating that a module or method is not found.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine you're using a library called `react-native-awesome-library` with a native module. The React Native app attempts to use a function: 
```javascript
import AwesomeLibrary from 'react-native-awesome-library';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const result = AwesomeLibrary.doSomethingAwesome();
  return <Text>{result}</Text>;
};
```
If the native module is not correctly linked or if there is an issue with the native code, you will encounter the error.

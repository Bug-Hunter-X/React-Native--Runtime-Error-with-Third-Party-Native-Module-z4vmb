# React Native: Runtime Error with Third-Party Native Module

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications involving third-party libraries with native modules. The error arises from incorrect linking or problems within the native module's implementation. This can manifest as a runtime crash or a message like 'undefined is not an object'.

## Bug Description:

A React Native app uses a library with native modules.  When calling a function from this module, the app crashes, displaying an error suggesting the module or function is undefined.

## Solution:

The solution involves verifying the native module linking process and potentially inspecting the native module code for issues.  The steps are:

1. **Verify Library Installation and Linking:** Ensure the library is correctly installed and linked according to its documentation.  This may involve running post-installation scripts (e.g., `react-native link`) or configuring native project settings.
2. **Check Native Module Code (if possible):** If the problem persists and you have access to the native module's source code, inspect it for any errors or inconsistencies.  Look for potential compilation issues or runtime exceptions.
3. **Inspect the native module's ios/android files:** Look for a bridging file, if it is missing or has issues that might be the problem
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Clean and rebuild the project to ensure everything is up to date
5. **Verify Android/iOS Build Settings:** Carefully examine your Android and iOS project settings to make sure that the native modules are included correctly in the build process.
6. **Update Libraries:** Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date.  Outdated libraries can cause compatibility issues.
7. **Check for typos:** verify that library names and function calls are correctly typed in the code.
8. **Check for conflicting libraries:** If there are other libraries used that might create conflicts with the native library being used. 

This repo provides example code to illustrate the bug and its solution.
